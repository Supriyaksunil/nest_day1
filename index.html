    <p style="font-size: large; text-align: left;">Hello! Iâ€™m Supriya K S, a passionate and dedicated MCA student from Kerala, currently in my first year of study. With a strong interest in software development and problem-solving, I am eager to explore the world of programming, data structures, and emerging technologies.
        I have a keen eye for detail and a logical approach to problem-solving, which helps me tackle complex challenges efficiently. My academic journey in MCA is shaping my technical skills in areas such as programming languages, database management, and software engineering.
        Beyond academics, I am always curious to learn new technologies and apply my knowledge to real-world applications. I aspire to build innovative solutions that make an impact.<p>
